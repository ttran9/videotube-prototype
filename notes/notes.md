    - We used phpMyAdmin.
        - First we went to the "New" to generate a database called, "VideoTube."
        - After this we selected the database and created a table called "categories."
            - While I was watching this video I thought to myself about naming it "Category" but that is a topic for
            another day in regards to the naming convention and something I'm not worried about for this project.
        - After this I used the "Insert" tab to add in the sample categories.
        - After this I would view the inserted rows by viewing the "Browse" tab.
